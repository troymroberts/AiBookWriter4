# Crews Module
# Phase-specific crew configurations for BookWriterFlow

"""
This module will contain individual crew configurations for each phase:
- foundation_crew.py - Story arc creation
- world_building_crew.py - Characters, locations, lore
- structure_crew.py - Plot outline, chapter breakdown
- writing_crew.py - Scene/chapter generation
- editorial_crew.py - Critic, reviser, continuity checking

Currently, crews are created inline in BookWriterFlow.
This module can be expanded for more modular crew definitions.
