## 🎯 Scene Structure Demonstration (Dwight Swain Pattern)

### Example: Scene 1 → Scene 2 → Scene 3 Flow

**Scene 1 (ACTION)**:
- **Goal**: Investigate signal
- **Conflict**: Systems fail, crew panics
- **Outcome**: Signal decoded → leads to Scene 2

↓

**Scene 2 (REACTION)**:
- **Goal**: Process the emotional impact
- **Conflict**: Sophia's trauma creates doubt
- **Outcome**: Gains confidence → leads to Scene 3

↓

**Scene 3 (ACTION)**:
- **Goal**: Make first contact
- **Conflict**: Arkeia reveals threat, crew divided
- **Outcome**: Decision to land on planet → leads to Chapter 2

This demonstrates **proper scene progression** where each scene's outcome naturally leads to the next scene's goal.
