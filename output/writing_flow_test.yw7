      <SceneContent><![CDATA[Elena sat in her cramped Oxford office, surrounded by stacks of her late mentor's research notes. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the desk as she carefully examined a worn leather journal.

"What were you looking for, Professor?" she whispered, tracing her finger over a hand-drawn map tucked between yellowed pages.

The map depicted an uncharted region of the Amazon, marked with symbols she'd never seen before. At the center, a single word: "Temple."

Her phone buzzed. James Chen.

"Elena, you need to see this. I've been translating those symbols from Professor Wade's notes. I think... I think he found something incredible."

Elena's heart raced. Her mentor had died under mysterious circumstances six months ago. Now, perhaps, she could finally understand why.]]></SceneContent>

      <SceneContent><![CDATA[The next morning, Elena found an envelope slipped under her office door. Expensive paper, unmarked.

Inside, a photograph: her mentor's last excavation site. And beneath it, a handwritten note in elegant script:

"Dr. Thorne, some discoveries are meant to remain buried. Continue your research, and you'll share Professor Wade's fate. - M.V."

Elena's hands trembled. Marcus Vale. The name was whispered in archaeological circles - a wealthy collector known for acquiring artifacts through questionable means.

She pulled out her phone and texted James: "We need to talk. Someone's threatening me."

But instead of backing down, Elena felt her resolve strengthen. If Vale wanted to scare her off, it meant her mentor had been onto something real.]]></SceneContent>
