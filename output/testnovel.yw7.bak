**Title:** *Echoes of the Void*

**Premise:**
In the year 2150, humanity has colonized several planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Dr. Elara Myles, a brilliant xenobiologist, is tasked with investigating a mysterious signal emanating from a remote planet, Xylo-7. The signal appears to be a distress call from an unknown source, and the fate of the colony on Xylo-7 hangs in the balance. As Elara delves deeper, she uncovers a sinister plot that threatens not only the colony but the entire human presence in the Alpha Centauri system.
